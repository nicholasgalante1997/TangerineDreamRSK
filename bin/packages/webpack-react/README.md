## Styling

Components are styled using **CSS Classnames**. To assist in creating some of these classnames dynamically and on the fly within components based on states, we leverage the package `classnames`.

Here is an example of styling a component with this pattern.

**Folder Structure**

- src
  - components
    - Sample
      - Sample.tsx
      - classnames.ts
      - index.ts
  - styles
    - sample.css

**classnames.ts**

```ts
export const SampleClassnames = {
    Wrapper: 'sample-component__wrapper'
    Main: 'sample-component__main-section',
    Title: 'sample-component__title'
} as const;
```

**Sample.tsx**

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { SampleClassnames } from './classnames'

function SampleComponent() {
  return (
    <div className={SampleClassnames.Wrapper}>
      <div className={SampleClassnames.Main}>
        <h1 className={SampleClassnames.Title}>A Sample Component</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**sample.css**

```css
.sample-component__wrapper {
  /* ... */
}

.sample-component__main-section {
  /* ... */
}

.sample-component__title {
  /* ... */
}
```

## State Management

This app has minimal state management concerns. Currently, the app does not leverage any 3p solutions. We make use of Provider/Subscriber patterns that are easily craftable/derivable via the `React Context API`. All of our state (contexts), can be found inside of `src/contexts`. A given context file exports a `Provider`, which is a react component that wraps its child nodes in the ContextProvider and makes the context available to them downtree, and it also exports a hook that **child react components** can leverage to fetch data from higher in the tree. All of our context providers are wrapped/chained inside the **RootComponent** `src/components/root` which wraps the entire page/react-tree in a series of top level providers.

See **Higher Order Component Wrappers** OR **RootComponent** for a more in depth description.

## Component Development

Components are created in the `src/components` subdirectory.

Components follow a standard file structure / folder structure

- src
  - components
    - Example
      - **Example.tsx** (Component file)
      - Example.test.tsx (if there are tests) (Not mandatory)
      - Example.stories.tsx (if there are stories) (Not mandatory)
      - animations.ts (if there are animations) (Not mandatory)
      - **classnames.ts** (Class Names file)
      - **index.ts** (Exports file)

## Pages (Client and Server)

Pages are the top level components that are rendered for a given route. They build from components provided out of `src/components`.

All pages can be located in the `src/pages` directory.

Pages are used in both a client and server context.
